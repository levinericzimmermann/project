# Structure

- a sequence of slowly unfolding events, sounds
    - each breath matters

- composed of small parts
    - each part consist of:
        - N resonator-algorithms (where n >= 1)
        - whistling sequence
        - resonator result (concurrence, that may be longer than the actual part, e.g resonators can overlap)

- there is a global intonation envelope, that keeps track of all sounding intonations
    - each part writes into this intonation envelope once it's used

- how to order parts? how do parts decide for pitches?
